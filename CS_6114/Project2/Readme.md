Question 1
Data structures : Tree
Python version 3
AVL tree : It was the first such data structure to be invented. In an AVL tree, the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one; if at any time they differ by more than one, rebalancing is done to restore this property
Steps to run :
1.	Run program
2.	Follow the instructions give in code
Functions :
1.Insert	- This function inserts node into tree and then rebalancing is done on the tree to follow BST ruls.
2. Delete  This function deletes node from tree and the rebalances it again.
3. inorder_traverse – this function prints the tree nodes using inorder traverse logic.
4. chk_anagrams – anagrams are checked for each value in tree and it also prints those values.
5. is_max_heap – this function checks the heap is max heap or not. Since we are using BST (AVLTree) due to rebalancing it will only satisfy for n <= 2.
